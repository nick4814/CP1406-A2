<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>Testing details are listed in the above task list and requirements for each test are being communicated via the team Slack group messaging app.

</p>
<h2>References</h2>
<p>references (links) for any code, images or content that you have used that are not your own</p>
<ul>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Group members have all had a calm relaxed nature of working with other</li>
	<li>Each team member has recognised each others strengths and allocated duties accordingly. Each team member has been keen to help out wherever needed and is keen to learn from each other</li>
	<li>Clear honest and open communication has been the key to this groups successfully completing this project. Especially in terms of communicating conflicting deadlines so that the team can continually update the project plan to ensure deadline is met</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minuses:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>With us all being external students working full-time is difficult to have instantaneous communication (but our relaxed working nature has ensured this issue hasn't become a major issue as seems to be the case with feedback the team has been receiving about other teams</li>
	<li>Information relating to the assignment requirements have caused delays and extra rework for the team including issues with loading the site to the JCU server, being issued with team Slack accounts after having already started a private channel and being issued with the 'old' BRO site content after work on Milestone 2 had already commenced i.e. this team had initially discussed updating the live BRO site</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>the use of Zoom to host face-to-face meeting and share computer screen was an excellent resource</li>
	<li>Similarly, the use of Slack app to facilitate communication within the team (without having to reply on emails) has been excellent</li>
	<li>Setting up the OneDrive account to share documents was a bit of mission but well worth it otherwise we would have had to resort to either using Git (which should only be for the site content) or email (which would have meant possibly loosing track on the sent files) etc</li>
	<li>Working with others to create a project requires a lot more work to communicate, plan and complete administrative tasks that wouldnâ€™t normally be required when working alone. However it is clear that it makes the scalability of website creation a lot more feasible</li>
</ul>
