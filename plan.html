		<p>This assignment has been created by: Nick Neville, Greg McLindon and Kristen Scheuber</p>
		<h1>Assignment 2 - Barrier Reef Orchestra website</h1>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of the Barrier Reef Orchestra (BRO) website is to increase revenue for the orchestra by promoting upcoming performances with a view to attracting a new base of concert goers from a younger demographic. Advertising the benefits of membership (both community and musician membership) to the younger demographic is a secondary priority for site as it is the primary method for attracting new comers into the Orchestra.
		</p>
		<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>
			Analyse the demographics of the current membership and survey the next concert performance to create base-line reporting; Specifically counting the ratio of 15-30-year-old compared to 35-50 and over 50-year-old age groups. Then after a 12-month period following the release of the new website, repeat the membership analysis and survey to check if there has been an increase in the younger demographic members and concert goers. All other advertising including banners placed around various physical sites throughout the local community and social media (Facebook) is to remain consistent during this period so any increase in younger demographic can be attributed to the website. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Prior to the website being launch financial figures will be obtained to determine funds received from memberships, sponsorships and donations. After the website is launched the reports will continue to be run on a quarterly basis to determine if funds received by the Orchestra have increased or decreased as a result of the website. If the website is successful the Orchestra will see a noticable increase in memberships, sponsorships and donations received, helping the to acheive the target of increased revenue. 
		</p>
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			The BRO website is aimed at a younger target audience of 15-30-year-old. The look and feel of the website will be contemporary and fresh providing for quick/high-level navigation so the end user can find the information they are seeking in a quick and concise manner to match the busy schedule that this demographic tends to have. The website will contain little text-based content at the higher levels rather using visual tools to help the user scan the content such as calls for action and linked images that draw the users attention. This will assist concert goers seeking a brief interaction with the site to obtain the information they are chasing. However detailed information will still be maintained where relevant as a means of conveying the prestige of the BRO but these will generally be multiple clicks into the site only to be read by those users interested in finding out further information.
