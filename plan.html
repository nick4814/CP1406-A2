		<h1>Project Plan</h1>
		<h1>Assignment 2 - Barrier Reef Orchestra website - TEST CAN EDIT Greg McLindon</h1>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>
			Concisely state what the goal (purpose) of the website is.<br>
			Note that the mission must be to improve something in a measurable way.<br>
			Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific.<br>
			Good mission statements are usually only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information.
		</p>
		<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>
			Describe the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated.<br> 
			How do you know that the site does what the client wanted?<br> 
			Measure the mission you stated above.
		</p>
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>The target audience that your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for everyone)</li>
			<li>How you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from another, different target audience).</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Content</h2>
		<p>
			This section should contain a dot-point list of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on each of those pages.<br>
			Use a table or nested list or something clear. Create the flowchart from this.
