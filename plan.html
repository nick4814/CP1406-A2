		<h1>Project Plan</h1>
		<p>This assignment has been created by: Nick Neville, Greg McLindon and Kristen Scheuber</p>
		<h1>Assignment 2 - Barrier Reef Orchestra website</h1>
		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of the Barrier Reef Orchestra (BRO) website is to increase revenue for the orchestra by promoting upcoming performances with a view to attracting a new base of concert goers from a younger demographic. Advertising the benefits of membership (both community and musician membership) to the younger demographic is a secondary priority for site as it is the primary method for attracting new comers into the Orchestra.
		</p>
		<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>
			There is currently a lack of any analytics associated with membership and concert attendance. Therefore, the demographics of the current membership will be analysed and a survey of the attendees at the next concert performance will be undertaken to create base-line reporting; Specifically counting the ratio of 15-30-year-old compared to 35-50 and over 50-year-old age groups (non-gender specific). Then after a 12-month period following the release of the new website, repeat the membership analysis and survey to check if there has been an increase in the younger demographic members and concert goers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Further, prior to the website being launched financial figures will be obtained to determine funds received from memberships, sponsorships, donations and ticket sales. After the website is launched the reports will continue to be run on a quarterly basis to determine if funds received by the Orchestra have increased or decreased because of the website. 
		</p>
		<p> 	
			An increase of 5% in both membership and concert attendance combined with a 5% increase in revenue from membership, sponsorship, donation and ticket sales will be considered a successful website redevelopment. 
		</p>		
		<p>
			Note: All other advertising including banners placed around various physical sites throughout the local community and social media (Facebook) is to remain consistent during this period. In addition, ticket prices are to remain consistent throughout the survey period where possible. This will insure any increase in younger demographic can be attributed to the website. 
		</p>

		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
			The BRO website is aimed at a younger target audience of 15-30-year-olds that have an interest in music. This demographic of audience expects high-quality digital media as a reflection of the product and services that they suscribe to and associate with. Therefore the look and feel of the website will be contemporary and fresh providing for quick/high-level navigation so the end user can find the information they are seeking in a quick and concise manner to match the busy schedule that this demographic tends to have. Specifically the website will contain little text-based content at the higher levels rather using visual tools to help the user scan the content such as calls for action and linked images that draw the users attention. This will assist concert goers seeking a brief interaction with the site to obtain the information they are chasing. However detailed information will still be maintained where relevant as a means of conveying the prestige of the BRO but these will generally be multiple clicks into the site only to be read by those users interested in finding out further information as opposed to scaring away site visitors due to being overwhelmed with information as is the case with the current website. A contemporary feel and association with the community specifically the vibrant young target audience in the 15-35-year-old category, will be evoked by theming the website on the Great Barrier Reef which is the namesake of the orchestra. This includes using images that are of coral seas and reefs in conjunction with traditional media such as images of the orchestra performing. This approach is unique and will set the Barrier Reef Orchestra website apart from other Australian orchestra websites which ties in well with the companies ‘mission statement to be a community based orchestra.
